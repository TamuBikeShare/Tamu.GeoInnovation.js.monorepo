<div class="heading">Using AggieMap</div>

<p>AggieMap is intended to be used by students, staff, faculty and visitors of Texas A&M University as a wayfinding tool across the 5,200 acres and over 1,200 buildings that make up the campus.</p>
<p>AggieMap consists of a Google Maps base layer with an image overlay that is generated from GIS data, maintained by <a href="https://msi.tamu.edu">Facilities Coordination</a>, and icons for commonly sought items such as:
<ul>
	<li>Points of Interest</li>
	<li>Family Friendly Restrooms</li>
	<li>TAMULink campus WiFi</li>
	<li>Panoramic Room Images</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>AggieMap features a "search" page that allows visitors to search and locate:
 <ul>
	<li>Buildings
		<ul>
			<li>By Name</li>
			<li>By Number</li>
			<li>By Abbreviation</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Parking Lots
		<ul>
			<li>By Name</li>
			<li>By Number</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Points of Interest
		<ul>
			<li>By Name</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>		


<div class="heading">Linking to Features</div>
<p>One of the commonly requested features in the previous online campus map was the ability to link to a particular building. Many departemental webpages have a link to the building that contains their main office.  This enables users to easily find their way across the sprawling campus.</P>
<p>To link to a particular building:
<ol>
	<li>Click on the "Search" tab.</li>
	<li>Enter building search critera.</li>
	<li>Select search result that matches your desired building.</li>
	<li>Click on the pin placed on the building.</li>
	<li>In the "info bubble" that pops up, click on "Link to this building <img src="images/external-link-ltr-icon.png">".</li>
	<li>The window (or tab) that opens will have the link in the address bar.</li>
	<li>Copy the link and use within your e-mail or webpage</li>
</ol>
If you wish to link to multiple buildings, you can combine the building numbers in the URL.<br>
Example: <a href="http://aggiemap.tamu.edu/?Bldg=1800,0454" target="_blank">http://aggiemap.tamu.edu/?Bldg=1800,0454</a> will place markers on both the GSC (1800) and the MSC (0454).</p>
<p>If you want to link to a map that has a certain icon group enabled by default:
<ol>
	<li>Click on the Legend tab.</li>
	<li>Select the icon group you want displayed.</li>
	<li>Click the <img src="images/external-link-ltr-icon.png"> icon.</li>
	<li>The window (or tab) that opens will have the link in the address bar.</li>
	<li>Copy the link and use within your e-mail or webpage.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<div class="heading">Bookmarking a "View" on AggieMap</div>

<p>The newest feature on AggieMap is the "save" feature.  This enables you to turn on the layers and icons, find the buildings that you want to display, zoom to a particular area of campus, and then save this for a later date or to share with others.</p>
<p>To "save" a view on AggieMap:
<ul>
	<li>Get your map how you like it, using any of the above mentioned features.</li>
	<li>Click on the "Save & Print" tab.</li>
	<li>Click on "Click here to generate a short link to this map".</li>
	<li>Copy the link that is presented below the button.</li>
	<li>Share that links with others.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<div class="heading">Printing from AggieMap</div>

<p>Printing From AggieMap is currently difficult.  The best results can be achieved by opening your browser's print settings and then verifying that "Enable Background Images" is enabled.  This ensures that the images that make up the map will be printed.</p>
<p>Soon, we hope to have a method that will "capture" your browser's view (including icons, buildings pinned, and layers activated) that will generate a picture (or PDF) of what you were seeing.  This picture (or PDF) will be much easier to print and/or save.</p>
